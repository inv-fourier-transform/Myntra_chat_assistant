QUESTION,ANSWER
Why are there different prices for the same product? Is it legal?,"Myntra is an online marketplace platform that enables independent sellers to sell their products to buyers. The prices are solely decided by the sellers, and Myntra does not interfere in the same. There could be a possibility that the same product is sold by different sellers at different prices. Myntra rightfully fulfils all legal compliances of onboarding multiple sellers on its forum as it is a marketplace platform."
How can I contact any seller?,"Myntra.com is a marketplace on which third-party sellers sell products to customers. To contact a seller or raise any grievance against them, please send a letter with the below address on the envelope and include product page URL so that it can be forwarded to the seller. "
"I saw the product at Rs. 1000 but post clicking on the product, there are multiple prices and the size which I want is being sold for Rs. 1600. Why is there a change in price in the product description page?","Myntra is an online marketplace, and multiple sellers could be selling a particular style at different prices as may be set by each such seller respectively. The product price on the listing page of the platform, may not always reflect the lowest price for that particular style. This is because the seller whose price is displayed on the list page is selected based on the application of a number of parameters and price is only one such parameter. However, once you land on the product display page on the platform for a specific style, you will have access to the price offered by all sellers on the platform for the relevant style."
How will I detect fraudulent emails/calls seeking sensitive personal and confidential information?,"If you receive an e-mail, a call from a person/association claiming to be from Myntra seeking sensitive confidential information like debit/credit card PIN, net-banking or mobile banking password, we request you to never provide such confidential and personal data. We at Myntra or our affiliate logistics partner never ask for such confidential and personal data.
